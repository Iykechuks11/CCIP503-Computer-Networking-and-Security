# Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach

This repository is a documentation of my personal study of Computer Networking and security (CCIP503) during my first semester towards a masters degree in Applied Cyber Security at Kadir Has University.

For this course, I used the text, "Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach", authored by James F. Kurose (University of Massachusetts, Amherst) and Keith W. Ross (Polytechnic Institute of NYU). Each chapter is presented as a directory that contains a README file that comprimeses the notes of the chapter and any other helper links. Also, it contains a directory which has the solutions for chapter exercises. Not all exercises will be solved in a time. It is an ongoing process.
